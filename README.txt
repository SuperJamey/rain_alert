* Rain Alert

I created this file learning Udemy 100 days of Python.

It is hosted on https://www.pythonanywhere.com and runs a script
everyday at 6am using the API from www.twilio.com.

The script uses openweather.org to determine if rain is forcasted
at my LATITUDE and LONGITUDE for the next 12 hours.

The script then sends me an SMS to alert me that rain is forcasted
in my area.
